          <h4> Read </h4>
          <p> Each reading should be of the upcoming material. Prior to reading,
              identify what main ideas to look for. While reading, focus on
              these main ideas. Click for more information on reading. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4> Practice </h4>
          <p> Practice should be whatever you can find that tests your knowledge,
              understanding, and/or skill on material. This is often done through
              provided class material (such as practice problems), online
              testing resources, notecards, and/or other creative ideas. Remember, if this feels
              difficult it means it is working! Click for more information on
              practice. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4> Recall </h4>
          <p> Recall involves going through learned material and forcing yourself
              to remember important ideas in order to reconstruct what you already
              learned again. This is key to remembering the information. The harder
              the recall is the better the learing! Click for more information
              on recall. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4> Self Asess </h4>
          <p> Self assess is all about finding where you are at. This is usually
              done through self quizing. Use some sort of self assessment and
              grade yourself. Use this to guage what ideas you have a good
              understanding of and what ideas need more work. Click for more
              information on self assessing. </p>
